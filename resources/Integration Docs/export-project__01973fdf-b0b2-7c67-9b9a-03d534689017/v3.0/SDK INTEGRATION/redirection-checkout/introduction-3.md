**Hosted/Redirect Checkout** allows you to hand over the entire checkout process to Plural, ensuring a seamless and secure experience. Customer payment information is safely stored with Plural, removing the need for **PCI **compliance implementation on your end. Customers are redirected to a **Plural-hosted page** to complete their payment, and their payment details are securely transmitted to Plural's servers, guaranteeing a smooth and protected transaction.

**How it works:**

1. Merchants integrate Pluralâ€™s payment gateway into their website.
2. Customers choose their preferred payment method and enter payment details on the form.
3. Upon clicking the "Pay" button, customers are redirected to a Plural-hosted payment page to complete the transaction.
4. Once the payment is successfully processed, customers are redirected back to the merchant's website, where they can view the payment confirmation.
