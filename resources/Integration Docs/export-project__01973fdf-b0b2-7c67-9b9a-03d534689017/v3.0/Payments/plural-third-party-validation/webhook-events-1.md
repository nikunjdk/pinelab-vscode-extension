We use webhooks to notify you about important events on your third party validation. These webhooks contain details about the event, such as the changes that occurred and the resources impacted by the change.

We send webhooks as HTTP POST call to a URL configured by you. Webhook payloads use the JSON format.

> - For URL configurations and whitelisting of the IP addresses contact our Integration Team.
