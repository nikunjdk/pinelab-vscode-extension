Third-Party Validation (TPV) of bank accounts is a mandatory requirement for businesses in the BFSI (Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance) sector, particularly those involved in Securities, Broking, and Mutual Funds. According to Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) guidelines, investors must make transactions exclusively from the bank accounts they registered when onboarding with your business.

By integrating with Pine Labs TPV APIs, you can ensure compliance with SEBI's guidelines for online payment collections. Pine Labs offers seamless TPV integration with major banks at checkout, allowing investors to complete payments via UPI Collect and Intent flows.

## Use Cases:

1. **Securities Trading**: A brokerage firm allows investors to buy and sell stocks through its online platform. To comply with SEBI regulations, the firm must ensure that all investments are made from the bank accounts registered by investors at the time of account creation.  
   Integrating with Pine Labs TPV at checkout verifies that the payment is being made from the registered bank account, preventing the use of unauthorized accounts and ensuring regulatory compliance.
2. **Mutual Fund Investments**: An Asset Management Company (AMC) enables investors to invest in mutual funds through their portal. All investments must be made from the registered bank account while onboarding to adhere to the SEBI's regulations.  
   Integrating with Plural Third-Party Verification (TPV) ensures that payments for mutual fund purchases are validated against the registered account details, thereby reducing the risk of fraud and enhancing investor protection.
