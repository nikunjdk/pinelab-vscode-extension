Plural iFrame Integration is a method of embedding an external web page, service, or content into another webpage using an inline frame (iFrame) HTML element. This integration allows your business to embed a secure payment page directly within your site, enabling your customers to complete seamless transactions without being redirected to another site.

Plural iFrame integration reduces development complexity by minimizing the setup and maintenance requirements of your development team.
