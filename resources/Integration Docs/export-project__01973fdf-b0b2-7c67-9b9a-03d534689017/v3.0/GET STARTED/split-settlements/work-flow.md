## Overview of the Process

1. The customer initiates and completes a payment.
2. The payment gateway processes the transaction.
3. The settlement is split according to instructions given while creating the order acceptance request
4. Each stakeholder receives their respective share directly into their account.

## Key Components of the Flow

1. **Configuration of Split Rules**: You can define static settlement rules during order creation for each stakeholder.
2. **Settlement Execution**: The system ensures timely and accurate payouts.
3. **Dashboard Monitoring**: You can monitor settlements and transaction details in real-time on [plural dashboard](https://developer.pluralonline.com/docs/about-dashboard).

## Split Settlement Flow

The diagram below illustrates how split settlements work against an order. It also explains how settlement and refund behaviours vary based on the status of each split.
