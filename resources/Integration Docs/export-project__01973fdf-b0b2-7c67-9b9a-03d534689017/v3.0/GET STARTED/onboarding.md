## User & Role Management

Plural allows the **Owner** account to add other members of your team as **users** to access the common merchant ID. Plural allows any user with the right permission to assign different **roles** (with different **permissions** assigned to each role) to users to manage and control their access to the various features and functions which can directly impact the main merchant account.

- By default, Plural has 3 roles which can be edited by the **Owner** account or any user with the right permission as per their preference: Operations, Finance & Support. 
- Examples of permissions relevant for User & Role Management include ‘CREATE USER’, ‘CREATE ROLE’, and ‘UPDATION AND DELETION OF USERS’.
- Security and privacy is at the forefront for Plural, with Plural using 2-factor authentication to allow users to login. 

Steps to add or manage a ‘User’:
