Integrating with the Plural OpenCart Plugin enables seamless payment processing through credit cards, debit cards, and EMI options via the PinePG Edge platform.

### Integration Steps

Connect your OpenCart site with the Plural Payment Gateway by following these installation steps for the OpenCart payment gateway plugin.

#### Installing an Extension

OpenCart 2.x and 3.x extensions usually come in a `.zip` file, often containing installation instructions, update details and a file named with the `.ocmod.zip` extension.

2. Click on `Code`, then select `Download ZIP` to download the extension file.

   1. Navigate to `Extensions` and select `Extension Installer`. 
   2. Click the `Upload` button and
   3. Select the `*.ocmod.zip` file for the extension.

2. **Handling File Conflicts**: If the extension includes files that exist on your site, youâ€™ll receive an alert in the `Files that will be overwritten` box. Review the list to ensure no OpenCart core files are overwritten.
