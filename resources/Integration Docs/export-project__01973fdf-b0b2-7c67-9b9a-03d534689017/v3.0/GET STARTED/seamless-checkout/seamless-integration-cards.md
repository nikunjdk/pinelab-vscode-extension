## Overview

Cards, in the context of payments, refer to physical or virtual instruments used to facilitate financial transactions. They typically come in the form of plastic cards with embedded microchips or magnetic stripes, although virtual cards are gaining popularity for online transactions. These cards are linked to a specific account, allowing users to make purchases or withdrawals without carrying cash.

## How do card payments work?

The card payments ecosystem involves a complex network of entities and processes that facilitate electronic transactions between customers, merchants, banks, and payment gateways. Here's an overview of how the system works:

- **Customer Initiates Payment**: The process begins when a customer makes a purchase using a credit or debit card on the merchant's website. The customer provides card details, including the card number, expiry date, and CVV code.
- **Merchant's Website & Mobile Apps**: The merchant's website/mobile application collects the payment information and securely transmits it to the Payment Gateway.
- **Payment Gateway**: The Payment Gateway acts as an intermediary between the merchant's website and the acquiring bank. It encrypts the customer's payment details and forwards the information to the acquiring bank for authorization.
- **Acquiring Bank**: The Acquiring Bank receives the payment authorization request from the Payment Gateway. It checks the transaction details, verifies the customer's account, and ensures that there are sufficient funds in the account for the transaction.
- **Authorization**: If the transaction is approved, the acquiring bank sends an authorization code back to the Payment Gateway. If declined, the reason for the decline is communicated back to the merchant.  
  Payment Processor: The Payment Processor, affiliated with the acquiring bank, processes the authorized transactions. It debits the customer's account and credits the merchant's account with the transaction amount, minus any fees.
- **Merchant Confirmation**: The Payment Gateway informs the merchant's website about the transaction status. The customer receives a confirmation of the successful payment.
