You can initiate a refund for the captured payment against an order from the dashboard. This could be done from the payments section where all the orders are listed. Use our Refunds section to manage your refunds and create a bulk refund.

**Real-Time Tracking**: You can monitor all the refunds initiated from your account in the refund section of the dashboard. Once a refund is initiated, it immediately appears in the transaction history, allowing you to track its progress in real time.

**Refund Order ID**: Pine Labs generates a refund order ID for each transaction, making it easy for you to track and reconcile the refund request.
