Settlement is the process where the funds collected from your customers' transactions are transferred to your bank account. This marks the final step in the payment cycle, ensuring that the money from completed transactions is deposited into your Bank account. You can manage settlements using APIs or from theÂ Dashboard.

Captured payments are auto-settled into your bank account (which was provided during your KYC verification), following your designated settlement cycle.

The table below list the various settlement APIs which helps you to manage your transactions efficiently.
