Plura's Same Day Settlement feature enables you to receive your funds on the same day the transaction occurs, rather than waiting for the typical settlement periods like T+1 or T+2. This can enhance your cash flow and give you quicker access to your money.

## Key Benefits:

1. **Faster Cash Flow**: You can receive payouts on the same day.
2. **Multiple Payout Batches**: Transactions are settled in batches throughout the day.
3. **Flexibility**: Available for both Payment Gateway (PG) and Offline (PC) merchants.

## Key Features:

1. **Payouts Against Transactions are Made on the Same Day**
   - Every batch processes transactions that occurred since the last batch payout.
   - Ensures timely settlement for better financial planning.
2. **Multiple Payouts Per Day**
   - **PG Merchants**: Receive 5 payouts a day at 9 AM, 11 AM, 1 PM, 3 PM, and 5 PM.
   - **PC Merchants**: Receive 2 payouts a day at 12 PM and 5:30 PM.

> ðŸ“˜ Currently, SDS payouts are processed through three nodal banks:  
> â€¢	HDFC Bank  
> â€¢	Axis Bank  
> â€¢	RBL Bank (subject to a 30-minute delay due to processing issues at the bank's end)

## Same Day Settlement Fee Structure

1. Premium charges apply for opting into SDS.
2. A separate fee will be created on top of the Merchant Discount Rate (MDR).
3. The fee is charged based on payout frequency and merchant type.
