On-Demand Settlement (ODS) puts cash flow control directly in your hands, enabling you to request captured funds anytime through your dashboard. With real-time processing, transparent fees, and instant notifications, you can manage liquidity efficiently and eliminate settlement delays.

Traditional settlement cycles, such as T+1 or T+2, often create cash flow constraints. ODS transforms these rigid cycles into a flexible, user-controlled process, allowing you to access your funds immediately, even on weekends, bank holidays, and non-working days. This ensures continuous cash flow without waiting for standard settlement cycles.
