<details><summary><b>7. How does Weekend Settlement differ from a standard T+1 Working Day Settlement?</b></summary><br>
The <b>Weekend Settlement</b> option in Plural provides a faster settlement process compared to the standard <b>T+1 Working Day Settlement</b>. Here's how they differ:  

<b>Standard Settlement (T+2) with Plural:</b>  

- If a customer transacts on <b>Saturday (Bank Holiday)</b>, the settlement follows the standard <b>T+2 cycle</b>.  
- If <b>Monday is a working day</b>, Plural settles the amount to the merchant on <b>Monday (T+2)</b>.  
- If <b>Monday is a Bank Holiday</b>, the settlement is further delayed, and Plural settles the amount on <b>Tuesday (T+2)</b>.  

<b>Weekend Settlement (T+1) with Plural:</b>  

- If <b>Weekend Settlement is enabled</b>, all transactions are settled on a <b>T+1 basis</b>, ensuring faster fund availability for merchants.  
- A transaction made on <b>Saturday (Bank Holiday)</b> will be settled on <b>Sunday (T+1)</b> instead of being delayed to Monday or Tuesday.  

This feature allows you to receive settlements more quickly using Plural, even on weekends and bank holidays, thereby improving cash flow and reducing delays in fund transfers.
