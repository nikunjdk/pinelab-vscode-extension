A refund is a process when a receiver returns money back to a customer for a canceled or disputed transaction. This typically happens when a customer returns a product, cancels a service, or faces an issue with their purchase. The purpose is to reverse the original transaction and return the funds to the customer.

Plural processes refund directly to the customer's original payment method to prevent chargebacks. For example, if a credit card was used for the payment, the refund will be returned to that same credit card.
