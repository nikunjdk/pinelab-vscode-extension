When processing an API, it is important for us to know who is sending the request and if they have permission to perform the action. API Authorization helps us identify who is making the call, if they have the required permissions, and ensure you securely access the requested data.

Plural uses bearer token to authorize our API calls. All API calls must include an authorization header in the request.
