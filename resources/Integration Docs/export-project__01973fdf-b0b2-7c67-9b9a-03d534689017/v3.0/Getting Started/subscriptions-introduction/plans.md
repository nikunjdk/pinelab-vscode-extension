A Plan serves as the foundation for a Subscription, acting as a reusable template that defines the products or services offered, the pricing structure, and the billing cycle frequency. The billing frequency specifies how often your customers are charged daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, or at custom intervals ensuring automated and timely payments. Plans provide flexibility, allowing you to create multiple variations with different pricing models and billing intervals based on your requirements. 

By setting up a Plan, you can streamline the subscription process, ensuring consistency and automation in recurring payments.
