The transactions are made using a debit and credit card to purchase goods or services. These transactions can occur in-person at a physical store, or online through an e-commerce platform. The process involves transferring funds from the cardholderâ€™s account to the merchantâ€™s account via a secure network of banks and payment processors.

Cards, in the context of payments, refer to physical or virtual instruments used to facilitate financial transactions. They typically come in the form of plastic cards with embedded microchips or magnetic stripes, although virtual cards are gaining popularity for online transactions. These cards are linked to a specific account, allowing users to make purchases or withdrawals without carrying cash.
