Plural Hosted Checkout is a payment solution where the customer is redirected from a merchant's website to a secure, third-party payment page to complete a transaction. Plural handles the entire checkout process, including capturing payment details, ensuring security, and processing the payment. After successful payment, the customer is redirected back to your site.

With Plural hosted checkout, you can accept payments through different methods such as credit and debit cards, UPI, net banking, wallets, and our Affordability Suite, providing flexibility to your customers and enhancing their purchasing power.
