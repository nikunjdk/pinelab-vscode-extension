Integrating with Plural's Offer Discovery API allows you to identify the bank and brand EMI offers available for a specific card.

This API allows you to query eligible offers for a given order. It processes the `order_amount` and `product_details` provided in the request payload and returns applicable offers based on predefined rules and configurations on your Merchant ID.

You can integrate this API at the product or cart page to dynamically display eligible offers for the items in the customerâ€™s cart.
