This API enables cardless offer discovery by validating offers based on the `order_amount` and `registered_mobile_number`. It is designed for scenarios where customers do not use traditional card payments but prefer cardless options like mobile-based transactions.

You can integrate this API at the product or cart page to dynamically display eligible offers for the items in the customerâ€™s cart.
