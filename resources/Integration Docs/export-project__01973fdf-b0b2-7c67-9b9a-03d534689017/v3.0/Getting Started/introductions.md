Plural by Pine Labs is an embedded finance platform that allows you to integrate complex online payment solutions into your application with ease.

Currently, you can use our APIs to:

- Seamless API Checkout.

We use HTTP-based APIs that follow the REST architecture. Most of our APIs accept JSON request body and return JSON-encoded responses.

Our APIs use the standard HTTP response codes to indicate a successful or failed API call. All successful API calls return a 2XX response code. You can treat any non-2XX HTTP response as a failed call.
