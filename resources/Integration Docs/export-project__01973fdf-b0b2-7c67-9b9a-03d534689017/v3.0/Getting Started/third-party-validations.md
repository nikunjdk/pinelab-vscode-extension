Third-Party Validation (TPV) of bank accounts is a mandatory requirement for businesses in the BFSI (Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance) sector, particularly those involved in Securities, Broking, and Mutual Funds. According to Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) guidelines, investors must make transactions exclusively from the bank accounts they registered when onboarding with your business.

By integrating with Pine Labs TPV APIs, you can ensure compliance with SEBI's guidelines for online payment collections. Pine Labs offers seamless TPV integration with major banks at checkout, allowing investors to complete payments via UPI Collect and Intent flows.
