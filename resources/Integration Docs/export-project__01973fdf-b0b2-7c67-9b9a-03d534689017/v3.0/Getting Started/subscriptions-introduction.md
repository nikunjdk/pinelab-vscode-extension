The Subscription API Suite enables seamless recurring billing management by allowing you to define, create, and automate subscription-based payments. This suite comprises four key components: Plans, Subscriptions, and Presentations, ensuring a flexible and efficient billing process.

## Key Components:

1. **Plans**: Define the pricing structure, billing frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, or custom), and payment terms. Plans serve as reusable templates to standardize subscription offerings.

2. **Subscriptions**: Manage recurring billing cycles where customers are charged at predefined intervals based on the selected plan. Automate payments to ensure consistency and revenue predictability.
