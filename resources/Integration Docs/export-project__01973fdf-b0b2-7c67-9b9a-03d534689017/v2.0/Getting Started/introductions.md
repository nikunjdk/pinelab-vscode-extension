Plural by Pine Labs is an embedded finance platform that allows you to integrate complex online payment solutions into your application with ease.

Currently, you can use our APIs to:

- Create a Payment by Points.
- Payment Links.
- Subscription Payments.
- Affordability Suite.
- Payouts.
- Account Verification.
- UPIverse
  - UPI Payment Gateway.
  - UPI Intent Flow.
  - UPI Auto Flow.
  - UPI Switch.
  - UPI DeepLinks.

We use HTTP-based APIs that follow the REST architecture. Most of our APIs accept JSON request body and return JSON-encoded responses.

Our APIs use the standard HTTP response codes to indicate a successful or failed API call. All successful API calls return a 2XX response code. You can treat any non-2XX HTTP response as a failed call.
