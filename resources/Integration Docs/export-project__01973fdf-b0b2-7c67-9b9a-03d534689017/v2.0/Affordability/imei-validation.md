Integrating with Plural, you can now include an IMEI verification flow, enabling merchants to verify product IMEI or serial numbers during the payment. This feature ensures compliance and enhances efficiency by integrating IMEI verification.

Product return flow is handled by Plural, where Plural unblocks the IMEI number upon successful return.
