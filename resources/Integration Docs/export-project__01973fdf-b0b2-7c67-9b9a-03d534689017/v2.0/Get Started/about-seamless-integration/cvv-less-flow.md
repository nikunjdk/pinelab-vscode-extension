A CVV-less transaction allows your customers to process a payment without requiring their card's CVV [Card Verification Value]. This can be used for saved cards as tokens, where CVV is not necessary for repeated transactions, such as tokenized payments or card-on-file services. 

CVV-less transactions enhance customer convenience by simplifying the payment process for recurring or saved card transactions. This improves the customer experience by reducing friction during checkout. While still maintaining security through tokenization and other robust verification methods. This balance enhances convenience without compromising safety.

## Supported Networks:

- Visa 
- Mastercard 

> ðŸ“˜ NOTE:
> 
> - This feature is only supported for seamless card transactions.
> - You can implement a CVV-less flow for processing payments on your systems, provided that the token type used is `NETWORK_TOKEN_TXN`.
> - For Visa and Mastercard tokenized transactions, the cvv parameter can be omitted.
