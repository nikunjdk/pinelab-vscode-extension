A subscription is a recurring billing model where customers pay an amount at pre-defined intervals (monthly, annually, etc.) for access to your product or service. This creates a predictable revenue stream for your business and fosters long-term customer relationships. These are automated payments on schedule that are pre-defined by you.

## Use Cases

1. **OTT Platforms**: Streaming services offer subscriptions for on-demand movies, series, and exclusive content. With different payment method, you can set up recurring payments for their monthly or annual subscriptions, ensuring uninterrupted access to entertainment without the hassle of manual renewals.
2. **E-Learning Platforms**: Online learning platforms provide subscriptions for courses, certifications, and exclusive materials. Subscriptions streamline access to content, with periodic payments enabling continuous learning without disruptions.
3. **E-commerce Subscriptions**: E-commerce platforms provide subscription models for curated product deliveries, such as beauty boxes or groceries. Customers can choose a subscription plan, enabling automatic periodic payments and deliveries without needing to reorder each time.
