## Payouts Overview

A payouts is the transfer of funds to a bank account or a wallet in the form of a deposit. 

Large corporations and SMEs face major pain-points while utilizing traditional banking infrastructure to make payouts. Payouts and disbursals using the traditional banking infrastructure require cumbersome and non-flexible manual efforts. No impactful insights or analytics can be viewed using the traditional platforms. Bulk transfers can also happen via traditional banking platforms by uploading a spreadsheet on the banking portal or manually adding every beneficiary before transferring. But in such cases, a single error in a payment file can block all the bulk payments. Additionally, adding new beneficiaries is never instant. 

By utilizing existing the proposed payouts features, merchants can:

1. Make bulk payouts even if there are invalid records in a file, by ensuring that valid transfers go through. 
2. Receive reconciliation support for failed and invalid transfers so that merchants always know which transfer failed out of hundreds of payments, and why.
3. Add beneficiaries instantly. 
4. Automate payouts using APIs to make 24\*7 refunds and payouts to customers, partners and vendors for better UX. 
5. View financial summaries of payouts transactions to make better decisions. 
6. Remove transactional risks by enabling a maker-checker flow. 
7. Split marketplace payments to multiple vendors or stakeholders.
8. Share Payouts Links with customers, vendors and partners who can add their details and receive payouts instantly.

- Scheduled
- Queued
- Processing
- Processed
- Reversed 
- Cancelled 
- Rejected 
- Failed 

![](https://files.readme.io/746eab9-Payout_Status.png "Payout_Status.png")

### Pending

If the Approval Workflow feature is enabled on the account, a payouts is assigned the pending state if the payouts requires approval by checker roles, according to the workflow setup.

At this stage, the payouts details are stored in the system, but the state will require approval from checker roles to move to Verified state. No processing has been done either by Plural Payouts or the contact's bank.

#### Action Required

The payouts remains in this state until and unless the payouts is approved/rejected by the required user(s).From the pending state, payouts can either move to the:

- queued state if the account doesn’t have sufficient balance to process the payouts.
- scheduled state if you have scheduled the payouts.
- processing state if you have sufficient balance to process the payouts.
- rejected state if you reject the payouts or if you did not approve the payouts before the scheduled date and time

### Queued

A payouts is assigned the queued status only when there is not sufficient balance in the account.

At this stage, the payouts details are stored in the system, but no processing has been done either by Plural Payouts or the client’s bank

#### Action Required

The payouts remains in this state until you add sufficient funds to your business account.  
From the queued state, payouts can either move to the:

- processing state when you add sufficient balance to process the payouts.
- cancelled state if you cancel the payouts.

### Scheduled

The payouts remains in the scheduled state till the scheduled date and time is reached. At this stage, the payouts details are stored in the system and would require verification by the checker role to move to ‘Verified’ state.

No processing can be done either by Plural Platform or the contact's bank before payouts is moved to ‘Verified’ state.

From the scheduled state, payouts can either move to the,

- processing state when the scheduled time is reached post payouts is ‘Verified’ by checker role
- cancelled state if you cancel the payouts before the scheduled time
- failed state if you do not have sufficient balance to process the payouts.

> 📘 Note
> 
> The queued state does not apply to scheduled payouts.

### Processing

A payouts can acquire the processing state in one of three ways:

- From the verified state, when the designated person approves the payouts and you have sufficient balance to process the payouts.
- From the queued state, when you add sufficient funds to your account to process the payouts.
- Immediately, when a payouts is created if you do not have the Queued Payouts or Approval Workflow feature enabled on your account.
- At this stage, either Plural Payouts or the contact's bank could be processing the payouts. No further action is required by you while a payouts is in the processing state.

> 📘 Note
> 
> IMPS and UPI payouts can remain in the processing state for T+2 working days.

From processing state, payouts can either move to the:

- processed state if the payouts is successful.
- reversed state if the payouts fails.

### Deemed Success

Payouts made via IMPS and UPI can be in the processing state for up to T+2 working days. This happens since NPCI marks these payouts as deemed success or deemed approved. Below is how a payouts is processed from when it is authorized by you to when you receive the terminal payouts state (processed/failed/reversed).  
If NPCI is successfully able to credit money to your beneficiary account, it returns a success status to the partner bank who in turn returns it to us and we mark the payouts as processed.

If NPCI is not able to credit money to your beneficiary account, it returns a failed status to the partner bank, who passes the status to us and we mark the payouts as reversed.

Sometimes, there are technical errors when trying to credit the payouts to the beneficiary account. When this happens, it is not possible to be certain if the payouts was credited to the beneficiary. In such cases, NPCI moves the payouts to an intermediate state (deemed success). From this state, the payouts can go to the processed, failed or reversed state.

When we receive the deemed success from NPCI, we do not move the payouts to a terminal state. We do this to avoid returning a false positive state to you. Instead, we keep the payouts in the processing state till we receive the final status from the partner bank.

Once the transactions in the deemed success state are reconciled by the beneficiary bank and NPCI, we receive the final status from the partner bank and move the payouts to the terminal state (processed/failed/reversed). This could take T+2 working days.

### Processed

- The processed status means that payouts has been processed by the contact's Bank.
- A payouts in the processed state can move to the reversed state if a payouts failure is detected.
- This can happen due to various reasons such as the customer's bank reversing the transaction or if the payouts was reversed by the clearing house.

### Reversed

- A payouts acquires the reversed state when the payouts operation fails. This can happen due to issues with our partner banks, clearing house or even the customer's bank.
- As soon as Plural Platform identifies a payouts failure scenario, it moves the payouts to the reversed state and creates a reversal transaction that credits your business account with the original payouts amount and fees and tax (system should be flexible enough to process it for individual clients).
- No further action is possible on a payouts in this state.

### Rejected

A payouts in the pending state acquires the rejected state when:

- It is manually rejected by you.
- It is not approved by you before the scheduled date and time.  
  No further action is possible on a payouts in this state.

### Cancelled

A payouts can reach the cancelled state when the user manually cancel a payouts in the:

- queued state. You can cancel a payouts in the queued state either from the Dashboard or using APIs.
- scheduled state. You can cancel a payouts in the scheduled state from the Dashboard  
  A payouts that has been cancelled acquires the cancelled state. No further action is possible on a payouts in this state.

### Failed

This status is applicable only when a payouts is made using the current account balance.

- Payouts in the processing state move to the failed state when they are failed by our current account partner bank.
- Payouts in the scheduled state move to the failed state if you do not have sufficient balance to process them.  
  No further action is possible on a payouts in this state.
