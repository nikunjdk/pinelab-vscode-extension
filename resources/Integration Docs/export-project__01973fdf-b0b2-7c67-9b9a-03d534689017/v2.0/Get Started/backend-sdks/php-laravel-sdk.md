## Prerequisites

Before integrating the SDK into your Project, make sure the following requirements are met:

1. PHP version 7.4 or higher, up to 8.1.
2. Composer installed in your project.

> ðŸ“˜ Note:
> 
> TLS 1.2 information:
> 
> - For PHP 5.5.19 and above should have TLS version 1.2.
> - For PHP 7 and above, TLS version 1.2 is typically available.

## Installation

If your project uses Composer for managing dependencies, you can easily install the PHP library by  
following these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to your project's root directory where your`composer.json` file is located.
3. Run the below Composer command to install the PHP library:

```json Use Composer Command
composer require pinelabs/php
```

To locally add a PHP library to your `composer.json` file, follow these steps:

1. Download the PHP library and place it in a directory within your project. You can obtain the  
   library files from a source like GitHub, or by downloading a release archive.
2. In your PHP library, make sure it has an autoloading mechanism defined, usually within a  
   `composer.json` file. This is important to ensure that Composer can autoload the library's classes.  
   An example `composer.json` file for the library might look like this:

```json Json
{
  "name": "vendor-name/library-name",
  "autoload": {
    "psr-4": {
      "VendorName\\LibraryName\\": "src/"
    }
  }
}
```

3. Open your project's composer.json file and add a reference to the locally downloaded library. To  
   do this, you can use the path repository type. Add a repositories section and specify the local  
   path to the library, like this:

```json Json
{
  "repositories": [
    {
      "type": "path",
      "url": "relative/path/to/library"
    }
  ],
  "require": {
    "vendor-name/library-name": "*"
  }
}
```

Example file using Pine Labs SDK:

```json Json
{
  "repositories": [
    {
      "type": "path",
      "url": "./pinelab-sdk"
    }
  ],
  "require": {
    "pinelabs/php":"@dev"
  }
}
```

Replace `relative/path/to/library` with the actual path to the directory where the library is  
located within your project.

4. After updating your project's `composer.json` file, open your terminal or command prompt,  
   navigate to your project's root directory (where the `composer.json` file is located), and run:

```json Command
composer update
```

> ðŸ“˜ Note:
> 
> 1. Use Composer Install or Composer Update to ensure you have the latest version of the library.
> 2. The SDK is namespaced under `Pinelabs\Php`.
> 3. The API returns errors instead of throwing exceptions.
> 4. Options are passed as an array instead of multiple arguments, wherever applicable, to ensure greater flexibility and easier configuration.
