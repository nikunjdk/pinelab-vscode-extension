## Installation

Follow the below steps for installing the SDK in your project:

1. Extract the SDK (ZIP file) to a location on your system. For example, the files can be extracted into a folder named python-sdk.

    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/1f2dac9af56b972e0ca0f9de1b8ca48eb1a13effce5a881aafca92f257c1b4e5-image.png",
        null,
        ""
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "700px"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


2. Copy all files from the extracted folder to your Flask project or any Python framework you are using.

        "https://files.readme.io/d4f802212da4fb7f79c053a5fcfab4f530af0d3f4c98dec69b0286b2ac95a5af-image.png",
        null,
        ""
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "700px"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


3. Import Files in Your Project:

   - In a sample setup, files are imported into a Flask project `(Flask_Sample_PineLab`) inside a newly created folder named `pinelabs`.
   - For this sample project, this step is already done, but in your own project, you will need to copy the files and organize them accordingly.

   [block:image]{"images":[{"image":["https://files.readme.io/c601262998dbffe5491602c46b49cf6c8de1b9f4781e3b04547904ff688f723e-image.png",null,""],"align":"center","sizing":"700px"}]}[/block]

   <br />
4. Ensure the folder structure in your IDE includes the SDK files alongside your main classes and packages.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/ab29a9c4adeb66da97269a94b15f221a6eaf15af94a4c41c7d895d59ed7b52b7-image.png",
        null,
        ""
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "700px"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


5. To use this SDK locally from a folder, copy the SDK folder into your project directory and import it into your Python file.

```python Python
from src.pinelabs import Pinelabs
```
