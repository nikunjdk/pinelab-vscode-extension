You can integrate with Plural Credit Card EMI APIs to allow users to pay using a credit card in EMI against the purchase. Enables your customers to transform high-value purchases into affordable monthly instalments using their credit cards. The total transaction amount is deducted upfront from their credit limit and repaid in easy EMIs.

This will benefit your business by improving conversion rates, increasing average order value (AOV), and allowing you to offer No-Cost EMI by covering the interest charges.

Integrate the list of APIs below to use Credit Card EMI.

- **Calculate EMI**
- **Scheme Validation**
- **Accept Payment**
- **Process Payment**

In the create payment API response we return the challenge_url you need to use this URL to navigate your users to the checkout page.
