Plural payout support, Individual Transfers, and Bulk Transfers are two distinct methods of distributing funds, each suited to different use cases depending on the number of the transactions.

**Individual Transfer**  
In individual transfers, funds are sent to a single beneficiary at a time. Here are some options available for a Individual payout.

- Schedule Payout: You can schedule a time to process a payout request.
- Update Schedule Payout: You can update the schedule time of the payout request.
- Cancel Schedule Payout: You can also cancel a scheduled payout request.

**Bulk Transfer**  
Bulk transfer involves sending payouts to multiple beneficiaries in a queue. The sender uploads an Excel file containing beneficiary details, and the system processes all the payments simultaneously.
